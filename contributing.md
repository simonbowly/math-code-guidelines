# Contributing

Let's run this using pull requests so that the discussion is documented along the way.

* To suggest specific changes/additions/removals: edit the markdown README in your fork/branch and submit a pull request.
* To submit code examples: add code in a subdirectory of `examples` and submit a pull request.
* To start a discussion about a guideline more generally: raise an issue (reference one of the examples or include code snippets).

Let's debate things!
